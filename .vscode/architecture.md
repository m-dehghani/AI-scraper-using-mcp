Developing a scalable and robust AI-powered web scraping system in 2025 requires integrating several cutting-edge technologies—NestJS for modular backend development, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI tool orchestration and interoperability, and Ollama for privacy-focused, local large language model (LLM) inferencing. The challenge intensifies when targeting websites with infinite scroll functionality, as these demand advanced headless browser automation and dynamic content handling strategies.
This guide presents a technical deep-dive into architecting such a solution, walking through design decisions, practical code snippets, integration patterns, and best practices. The system will be able to crawl and extract data from modern single-page applications with infinite scroll and pipe page contents through locally hosted AI models for semantic analysis—with all components orchestrated and exposed via a NestJS MCP server. The guide leverages up-to-date practices, source examples, and real-world architectural patterns.
Component Overview
System Architecture and Flow
The proposed scraper operates in a standalone NestJS application, integrating MCP server functionality for standardized AI orchestration. Upon a user or LLM-triggered scrape command, the system:
- Spins up a headless browser session for the target URL;
- Handles infinite scroll logic (by simulating scrolling, clicking load-more buttons, or detecting sentinels);
- Extracts rendered HTML directly from the virtual DOM;
- Parses and cleans content using powerful HTML parsing libraries;
- Feeds the content to a local Ollama LLM via REST API for semantic analysis or information extraction;
- Exposes all steps and AI tools via MCP protocol, making the scraper orchestratable and externally accessible by LLM-powered agents or clients;
- Implements logging, monitoring, backoff, and error handling to ensure robustness and debuggability.
This architecture enables a completely automated, scriptable web-scraping-ai-analysis pipeline—fully compatible with agents (like Claude, Cursor, or Copilot Studio) and usable in both local and remote orchestrations.

1. NestJS Standalone Application for Web Scraping
NestJS is ideal for both full backend APIs and standalone CLI-style scraping utilities. Its modular architecture, dependency injection system, and rich ecosystem allow for clean separation of concerns. For web scraping, opting for a standalone application is beneficial, as it avoids unnecessary HTTP servers while giving access to the powerful IoC container and modularity:

import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule);
  // Custom app logic (e.g., start CLI parsing, service invocations, etc.)
  // ...
  await app.close();
}
bootstrap();

- Features:
- CLI-based invocation
- Supports orchestrating scraping runs via command line or programmatic API
- Modular architecture for easy extension (e.g., plugging in new extractors, parsers, LLMs)
- Dependency injection ensures that browser automation and AI analysis code are easily testable, interchangeable, and reusable
Best Practice: Encapsulate each functional domain (scraper, AI processing, MCP orchestration, logging) as its own Nest module/service, and favor feature-first structure for maintainability.


2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) — Overview and Application
2.1. What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes the interface between LLMs (and agents) and external tools, services, or data sources. It is inspired by API integration patterns (e.g., LSP for IDEs), but focuses on “AI tool orchestration”—exposing functions, resources, and workflows that agents can call or chain.
- Features:
- Tools: Expose stateless RPC-style functions
- Resources: Expose data endpoints for retrieval
- Prompts: Parametrizable prompt templates, usable by LLMs
- Progress Notifications: Support for long-running task feedback (e.g., scraping progress)
- Multiple Transports: STDIO, Streamable HTTP, SSE (legacy)
- Access/Identity: Built-in or external OAuth, guard-based authorization
- Interactive tool calls and user input elicitation
Analogy: MCP is the “USB-C” of AI tools: plug-and-play between agents and tool servers, regardless of their underlying tech.
2.2. NestJS MCP Integration
The @rekog/mcp-nest module bridges NestJS with MCP, making it seamless to expose services and tools to any AI agent, with nest-native DI and modularity:
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { McpModule } from '@rekog/mcp-nest';
import { ScraperTool } from './scraper.tool';

@Module({
  imports: [
    McpModule.forRoot({
      name: 'ai-scraper-mcp',
      version: '1.0.0',
      // transport: [McpTransportType.STDIO, McpTransportType.STREAMABLE_HTTP]
    }),
  ],
  providers: [ScraperTool],
})
export class AppModule {}

// scraper.tool.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Tool, Context } from '@rekog/mcp-nest';
import { z } from 'zod';

@Injectable()
export class ScraperTool {
  @Tool({
    name: 'scrape-infinite-scroll',
    description: 'Scrapes all content from an infinite scroll page and analyzes it with LLM',
    parameters: z.object({ url: z.string() }),
  })
  async scrapeAndAnalyze({ url }, context: Context) {
    // ... (invoke browser, extract content, pass to Ollama, etc.)
  }
}

- Transports:
- STDIO: For local CLI agents (efficient, secure)
- Streamable HTTP: For remote/MCP cloud orchestrations (parallel access, scalable)
- SSE: (legacy)
Best Practice: Define schema validation for tool parameters (with zod), guard MCP endpoints with JWT/OAuth for remote access, and provide progress updates for long-running tasks.


3. Headless Browser Automation (Supporting Infinite Scroll)
3.1. The Need for Headless Browsers
Modern web applications (SPAs) render content dynamically via JavaScript. For such sites—especially those using infinite scroll—a static HTTP fetch yields only placeholders, requiring full headless browser automation to simulate human interaction (scrolling, clicking, AJAX waiting).
Popular tools include:
- Puppeteer: Node.js API for driving Chromium browsers
- Playwright: Multi-browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with advanced automation features
- Browser Pool: Efficient management of browser instances for scaling
3.2. Handling Infinite Scroll
Infinite scroll mechanisms vary. The main automation patterns are:
- Scroll to Bottom in a Loop: Repeatedly scroll the window to bottom, wait for network activity to settle, and check for new content
- Sentinel Detection: Observe DOM nodes (e.g., last child) to infer end of data or use Intersection Observer API
- Load More Buttons: Programmatically click “Load more” after scrolling or when visible.
Example (Playwright/Puppeteer in Node.js):
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

async function scrapeInfiniteScroll(url: string, maxScrolls = 20) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
  let prevHeight = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < maxScrolls; i++) {
    await page.evaluate(() => window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight));
    await page.waitForTimeout(1500);
    const newHeight = await page.evaluate('document.body.scrollHeight');
    if (newHeight === prevHeight) break; // No more new content loaded
    prevHeight = newHeight;
  }
  const html = await page.content();
  await browser.close();
  return html;
}

Best Practice: Tune timeouts/delays, use network idleness checking, and ensure scroll attempts are capped to avoid endless loops.

3.3. Scaling and Resource Management
Proper handling of browser instances, connection pools, and session isolation is critical for performance and scalability, especially when running scraping jobs in parallel.
- Use libraries like browser-pool for orchestrating multiple browser contexts
- Isolate each scraping task in a fresh context to prevent session leakage
- Implement health and timeout logic to restart or recycle unhealthy browser instances

4. HTML Parsing and Data Extraction
4.1. Cheerio for DOM Parsing
Cheerio is the de facto HTML parsing and manipulation library for Node.js. It implements a subset of the jQuery API, so selecting, traversing, and modifying DOM elements is concise and idiomatic.
Example:
import * as cheerio from 'cheerio';

const $ = cheerio.load(html);
const items = [];
$('.item-class').each((i, el) => {
  items.push({
    title: $(el).find('.title').text(),
    link: $(el).find('a').attr('href'),
  });
});

- Fast, memory-efficient, and consistent
- Works on static HTML returned from browser automation tools
Best Practice: Keep the parsing logic modular and extensible for different target schemas (e.g., products, articles, profiles). Validate output structure against the LLM's expected input.


5. Ollama Local Model Integration
5.1. What is Ollama?
Ollama is an open-source suite for running and interacting with powerful LLMs locally. Unlike cloud APIs (OpenAI, Azure, Claude), Ollama ensures total privacy, no external dependency, and eliminates recurring costs.
- Key Features:
- Simple installation and model management (e.g., ollama pull llama3)
- RESTful HTTP API on localhost:11434 for programmatic access
- Seamless integration with third-party tools, RAG pipelines, and orchestration frameworks
Best Practice: Always check system resource requirements (RAM, VRAM, storage) before running large models. Start with lightweight models for prototyping.

5.2. Invoking Ollama from TypeScript/NestJS
Ollama API expects POST requests to /api/generate with the model and prompt, returning a JSON result.
Sample Service:
import axios from 'axios';

export class OllamaService {
  private baseUrl = 'http://localhost:11434';
  async processPrompt(model: string, prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    const response = await axios.post(`${this.baseUrl}/api/generate`, {
      model,
      prompt,
      stream: false // for simplest case
    });
    return response.data.response;
  }
}

This service can be injected into your workflow (e.g., after scraping and HTML parsing). Process the page text, clean it, and pass it to the LLM for analysis.
5.3. RAG and Context-Aware Searches
For more advanced analysis (semantic search, RAG workflows, Q&A), consider:
- Vector store integration (e.g., ChromaDB, as seen in langchain and ollama-rag-nest)
- Chunking and summarizing scraped data before prompt injection to LLM
- Streaming API for longer responses or interactive applications
Best Practice: Preprocess and reduce page content to relevant parts (e.g., removing navbars, ads) before feeding to the LLM, to save computation and increase accuracy.


6. Infinite Scroll Handling — In-Depth
6.1. Technical Challenges
Websites using infinite scroll are typically powered by:
- AJAX data fetching on scroll event
- Sentinel DOM element with Intersection Observer
- “Load More” buttons revealed after reaching a scroll threshold
- Time-based or event-based data fetching
The scraper must detect which mechanism is used and automate accordingly:
- Scrolling and waiting for document.body.scrollHeight to increment
- Monitoring network activity for XHR/fetch requests
- Clicking “Load More” in a loop until unavailable
- Extracting DOM elements after each batch
6.2. Pseudocode Loop for Infinite Scroll
let previousHeight = 0;
let attempts = 0;
const maxAttempts = 25;

while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
  await page.evaluate(() => window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight));
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000);

  const currentHeight = await page.evaluate('document.body.scrollHeight');
  if (currentHeight === previousHeight) {
    attempts++;
  } else {
    attempts = 0;
    previousHeight = currentHeight;
  }
  if (noNewContentDetectedFunction()) break;
}


- Customizable detection logic: Use number of list items, presence of “no more results” element, etc.
- Cap attempts: Avoid infinite loops, especially when scraping unknown sites.
- Rate limit and polite scraping: Wait between scrolls to mimic human behavior and evade anti-scraping mechanisms.
6.3. Anti-Detection and Error Handling
- Rotate user agents, use proxy pools for large-scale or production deployments
- Handle CAPTCHA gracefully: Log and skip, or integrate with third-party solutions if consent permits
- Monitor for HTTP errors and exponential backoff on 429/5xx responses

7. Scalability and Distributed Scraping
7.1. Principles of Scaling Web Scrapers
Asynchronously handling multiple websites, scaling out headless browsers, and orchestrating distributed workloads is key for real-time, high-throughput applications.
- Distributed Architecture: Spread scraping tasks across multiple worker servers, each with their own browser pool and LLM thread
- Queueing System: Use message brokers (e.g. Redis, RabbitMQ) to distribute URL jobs and store results
- Central Orchestration: MCP server coordinates tool availability, assigns work, aggregates results
Benefits:
- Horizontal scaling (more workers = more scraping power)
- Improved fault tolerance (if one worker fails, others continue)
- Reduced risk of IP bans (distributed proxies, geo-scaling)
Best Practice: Use orchestration frameworks like Celery (Python), BullMQ (Node.js), or Kubernetes Jobs in production to manage distributed workloads efficiently.

7.2. Scaling with Headless Browser Pools
- Browser-pool Libraries: Manage instance lifespans, maintain warm browser pools, perform health checks, and allocate browser sessions to scraping workers.
- Session Isolation: Always use a new context/user profile for each scraping session to prevent cross-data contamination.
- Graceful Recycling: Automatically restart browsers after N jobs or upon crash to maintain performance.

8. MCP Transports and Secure Communication
8.1. Transport Options
- STDIO: Ultra-low-latency, local-only. Used when MCP server and client reside on the same machine (CLI, agent plugin).
- Streamable HTTP: RESTful endpoints, suitable for networked/multi-client/microservice setups.
- SSE (Server-Sent Events): Legacy or for streaming scenarios, but generally replaced by Streamable HTTP.
- Security:
- STDIO is inherently secure (not exposed on network)
- HTTP endpoints must validate Origin headers, enforce authentication (OAuth/JWT), and bind to localhost by default for sensitive tools.
8.2. Implementation in NestJS MCP Server
Configure MCP in AppModule for chosen transport(s):
import { McpModule, McpTransportType } from '@rekog/mcp-nest';

@Module({
  imports: [
    McpModule.forRoot({
      name: 'ai-scraper-mcp',
      version: '1.0.0',
      transport: [McpTransportType.STDIO, McpTransportType.STREAMABLE_HTTP],
      // ...auth/session config as needed
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}


Best Practice: If exposing HTTP/SSE endpoints, always lock down with robust secrets, tokens, or external identity providers (e.g., Auth0, Keycloak).


9. Authentication and Security
9.1. Guard-Based Authorization
NestJS supports guard-based authorization at the route/tool level. MCP-Nest exposes guard hooks so you can protect tool executions and resource access:
- JWT, OAuth, or trusted API keys: Select an approach matching your use case; always use HTTPS for remote endpoints
- Session context validation: Enforce fine-grained access control based on the invoking agent/client
- Consent and Privacy: Comply with data privacy and user consent requirements at all stages.

10. Logging, Monitoring, Progress, and Error Handling
10.1. Logging and Monitoring
Instrument your scrapers to record:
- Start and finish times
- URLs processed, errors, retries, and progress steps
- Contextual trace IDs for correlating requests
Leverage:
- NestJS Logger for service-level logs
- Progress notifications via MCP so LLM/agent clients can display scraper status to users.
Middleware and Interceptor Patterns are used for request/response logging and error tracking in NestJS applications.
10.2. Error Handling and Retry Policies
- Implement retry with backoff for transient failures (network errors, rate limits, HTTP 429/5xx)
- Common strategies:
- Fixed Backoff: Wait a fixed time before retrying
- Exponential Backoff: Increase wait time exponentially after each failure
- Randomized Backoff: Adds jitter to reduce thundering herd effect
- For non-idempotent operations, ensure deduplication and proper state checks before retrying.
Best Practice: Always cap the number of retries and escalate persistent failures to human monitoring or alerting systems.


11. Project Architecture and Modular Design
- Feature-First Directory Structure: Group everything by features (e.g., /scraper, /ai, /mcp), not technical layer (controllers, services, etc.)
- Dependency Injection: Use DI for plug-and-play browser/AI/parser/queue components
- Extensibility: Each major function should be independently upgradeable and testable (e.g., swapping Playwright for Puppeteer, or changing from Ollama to another local LLM host)
- Testability: Leverage NestJS's built-in testing utilities for service and e2e tests
Best Practice: If exposing HTTP/SSE endpoints, always lock down with robust secrets, tokens, or external identity providers (e.g., Auth0, Keycloak).

Note: Illustrative only. Each service would warrant comprehensive implementation and error handling.

13. Best Practices for Real-World Deployments
- Ethics and Legality: Scraping must comply with target site terms of service, policies, and local regulations
- Resource Management: Monitor memory, CPU, and disk usage—especially with large headless browser pools and LLM workloads
- Data Cleansing: Filter, deduplicate, and postprocess results before storage or feeding to downstream consumers
- Scalable Design: Favor horizontal scaling; avoid monoliths for production scraping workloads
- Continuous Security Review: Regularly update dependencies and review open ports, secrets, and security patches

Conclusion
